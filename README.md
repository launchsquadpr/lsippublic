The LaunchSquad Intelligence Platform (LS/IP) is a suite of apps that work together to monitor and analyze media activity, social engagement, competitor coverage and web traffic to give clients a full view of the impact of their PR results and strategy.

The LS/IP was developed by LaunchSquad from the ground up to support and augment our unique set of capabilities and clients. This provides several distinct advantages over existing off-the-shelf solutions, such as: 

- Complete customization to match a client’s specific data needs,
- Greater flexibility in reporting structure and design,
- Tracking towards customized goals via our Google Analytics integration, and 
- An integrated human-review layer to avoid inaccurate results from automated data collection. 

The LS/IP measures results across earned, owned and paid media and combines into one easy-to-access online dashboard. The platform enables our teams and clients to more deeply understand which strategies are driving the most impactful results and ultimately use that data to evolve our program over time based on what’s most effective.
